## 🚀 Fund a Feature program

If your company/organization wish to prioritize the inclusion of new features in the project, you can use the fund a feature program:
- For each feature, a feasibility study for integration into the project would be conducted, along with a budget outlining the hours required for development, its estimated cost, and
delivery timeframe.
- Once the budget is accepted, a contract would be signed between both parties, specifying the scope of work, applicable legislation, and payment terms.
- The developed feature would be included in the project's source code, publicly available, with clear acknowledgment that you funded it.

To know more about this program, please contact [info@openuem.eu](mailto:info@openuem.eu) for more information.

## 🧾 Commercial support (consultancy, training services...)

## 🫂 Collaborative support

We're building a community in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UQNBuNej5u) where you can find help and support, but if you want to ask for a new feature or report a bug, please do fill an issue in GitHub to track the progress.

While I truly believe in Open Source and I enjoy providing help to others, if you ever found this project extremely helpful and you want to send me something as a gift (you don't have to but you know 😄) here you have my [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.es/hz/wishlist/ls/34678YVFGIAX5?ref_=wl_share)
